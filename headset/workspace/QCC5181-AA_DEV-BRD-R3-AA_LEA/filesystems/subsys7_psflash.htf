# These keys are used to configure the software or to save settings.
# See the corresponding adk\src\domains\common\ps_key_map.h


#USR1 - This key is reserved. It is used to save the last volume for HFP.
#       See hfp_profile.

# USR2 Setting for earbud to have a fixed role. 
# If this key is not set then the earbud will be able to switch roles (recommended)
# If fixed roles are to be used each earbud pair must have one primary and one secondary. 
# This setting is currently only supported on ROM based QCC512x parts.
#USR2 = [ 01 00 ] #Uncomment to set the earbud to always be a primary device
#USR2 = [ 02 00 ] #Uncomment to set the earbud to always be a secondary device
#USR2 = [ 03 00 ] #Uncomment to set the earbud to use a fixed role. Right earbud will be primary.

# USR3 Setting to enable device testing.
#
# The key controls access to several test modes, including the device test service.
#
# If this key is not set, or is zero, then the device will behave as normal.
# In all other cases, test support will be enabled on boot. The device may
# not support normal operation.
#
# Setting [ 01 00 ] enables the device test service, which uses the SPP interface.
# Setting [ 02 00 ] enables a test mode. LE connections are supported.
# Setting [ 03 00 ] enables RF testing. The device enables RF DUT mode.
#USR3 = [ 01 00 ] # Uncomment to enable device test mode

#USR4 = This key is reserved to store reboot action. 
#       See system_reboot.c

#USR7 - This key is reserved. It is used to save the status for device upgrade
#       See upgrade.h

#USR13 - This key stores delta gain (in fixed-point format Q6.9) between ANC golden gain configuration and calibrated gain
#during production test: FFA, FFB and FB
#For Earbud application, 3 words are used. Each for 1 ANC Path. Both single/parallel topology for Earbud contain 3 words.
