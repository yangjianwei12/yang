\brief      The audio router provides a standard API to enable or disable audio paths

Specific implementations of the audio router behaviour can be configured by the registration
of handlers with the AudioRouter_ConfigureCallbacks() function.

This implementation can then call into the audio router to connect and disconnect
sources as required.

/* The audio router has the concept of stable and transient states:

   Stable states are:
        audio_router_state_connected
        audio_router_state_disconnected
        audio_router_state_interrupted
        audio_router_state_to_be_resumed
        audio_router_state_invalid

   Transient states are :
        audio_router_state_new_source
        audio_router_state_connecting
        audio_router_state_connected_pending
        audio_router_state_disconnecting_no_connect
        audio_router_state_disconnecting
        audio_router_state_disconnected_pending
        audio_router_state_to_be_interrupted
        audio_router_state_interrupting
        audio_router_state_interrupted_pending

   When the audio router is updated, it shall typically poll the source state of a source it is
   either connecting/disconnecting or interrupting, until it has reached a stable state. This
   polling is performed by the function singleEntity_AttemptStableState()

   In most scenarios, if the state update of the generic source being controlled by the audio
   router is synchronous, then we shall pass through all the transient states in a single call to
   AudioRouter_Update(), terminating on a stable state. If the state update of the generic source
   is asynchronous, then we may end the AudioRouter_Update on a transient state.
