   \brief      USB Audio Silence Generator for unrouted sink endpoints.

               Whenever the host activates a USB-IN audio endpoint, it expects to receive
               data from the endpoint upon each poll, according to the defined interface settings.

               However, the application isn't always ready to route data into an endpoint --
               for instance, it could be waiting for a SCO connection to complete
               before it connects a voice chain to the endpoint.

               During this wait interval which can be several seconds long, the host
               ends up with empty packets whenever it polls the device, which has been
               observed to cause errors in host applications and even kernel panics.

               Thus, this component is intended to stream silence into the endpoint,
               until the application starts a DSP chain connected to this endpoint.
               If/whenever the chain is ever torn down, this component will pick up the slack,
               and continue streaming silence, ensuring the host is never starved of data.
