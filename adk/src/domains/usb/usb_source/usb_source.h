/* Windows host support USB HID HOOK-SWITCH input report and off-hook & ring LED output report.
 * Android host does not support any of the above, but it shall supports IncomingCallAccept and
 * OngoingCallTerminate through PLAY_PAUSE input report.
 * In USB application usb_app_audio_voice_1af, USB audio & USB Voice will share common speaker.
 * So during voice call, both USB audio and USB voice will be active.
 *
 * When device is enumerated at windows host,
 * usb_source_voice_ctx = context_voice_connected & usb_source_audio_ctx = context_audio_connected
 * So when there is a incoming call and RING is streamed over USB, speaker interface will be activated.
 * ​usb_source_voice_ctx = context_voice_ringing_incoming & usb_source_audio_ctx = context_audio_is_streaming
 * IncomingCallAccept() will sent HOOK_SWITCH_ANSWER input report and windows host shall accept call.
 * Once the call is accepted,
 * ​usb_source_voice_ctx = context_voice_in_call & usb_source_audio_ctx = context_audio_is_streaming
 * OngoingCallTerminate() will send HOOK_SWITCH_TERMINATE input report and android host shall terminate call.
 * Once call is terminated,
 * usb_source_voice_ctx = context_voice_connected & usb_source_audio_ctx = context_audio_connected
 * Windows host also support IncomingCallReject using BUTTON_ONE in USB HID telephony page.
 *
 * When device is enumerated at android host,
 * usb_source_voice_ctx = context_voice_connected & usb_source_audio_ctx = context_audio_connected
 * So when there is a incoming call and RING is streamed over USB, speaker interface will be activated.
 * ​usb_source_voice_ctx = context_voice_connected & usb_source_audio_ctx = context_audio_is_streaming
 * PlayPause() will send PLAY_PAUSE input report and android host shall accept call.
 * Once the call is accepted and mic interface is active,
 * ​usb_source_voice_ctx = context_voice_in_call & usb_source_audio_ctx = context_audio_is_streaming
 * OngoingCallTerminate() will send PLAY_PAUSE input report and android host shall terminate call.
 * Android host shall not support IncomingCallReject
