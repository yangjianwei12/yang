    \brief          Utility functions for managing advertising data in the format needed for the extended advertising APIs.

    The data packet is structured as a set of up to eight, thrty-two octet buffers.
    This is the format expected by ConnectionDmBleExtAdvSetDataReq and
    ConnectionDmBleExtAdvSetScanRespDataReq.

    When the data packet is created the client sets the maximum size of data
    (number of octetst) the packet can contain. This should be one of:

    - 31 : for legacy advertising PDUs
    - 251 : for extended advertising PDUs
