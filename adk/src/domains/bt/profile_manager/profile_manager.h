    \brief      The Profile Manager supervises the connection and disconnection of profiles
                to a remote device. It also tracks the profiles supported and connected with
                remote devices.

                These APIs are used by Profile implementations to register profile connection/disconnection
                handlers with the Profile Manager. They are also used by the Handset and Sink Services when
                either the Application or Topology layer wants to connect or disconnect some set of the
                supported profiles for a device. The Profile Manager also handles connection crossovers and
                is configurable to connect/disconnect the profiles in any order required by the Application.
