/*! \brief This table defines each goal supported by the topology.

    Each entry links the goal set by the SM with the procedure required to achieve it.

    Entries also provide the configuration for how the goal should be handled, identifying the following
    characteristics:
     - is the goal exclusive with another, requiring the exclusive goal to be cancelled
     - the contention policy of the goal
        - can cancel other goals
        - can execute concurrently with other goals
        - must wait for other goal completion
     - function pointers to the procedure or script to achieve the goal

    Not all goals require configuration of all parameters so utility macros are used to define a
    goal and set default parameters for unrequired fields.
