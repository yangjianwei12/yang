# Usage for this csv database
# This database consists of tuple <flag, option>.
# flag = feature flag which is supposed to be checked for filter.
# option = there are two options.
#          1. DEFINED = Remove the code inside "#ifdef flag" and keep the #else part.
#          2. NOT_DEFINED = Remove the code inside "#ifndef flag" and keep the #else part.
# Note: 
# New filters are required to be added in new lines.
# Spaces are not allowed between comma separated values. e.g. entry <FLAG, DEFINED> will throw error because of space before "DEFINED".
#
# Examples:
# FLAG_1,DEFINED
# FLAG_2,NOT_DEFINED
#
ADD_TO_RELEASE,NOT_DEFINED
