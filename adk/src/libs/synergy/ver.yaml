# This file contains the Synergy version, in this format, 
#   "MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION.FIX_VERSION"
#
#   MAJOR_VERSION: 
#          This version indicates a source breakage since the API set is not 
#          backward compatible with the previous release. For example an 
#          application written for 21.0.0 shall provide compilation errors 
#          when it is re-compiled with Synergy 22.0.0 release.
#          The usual reasons to bump the major version are
#          -  Introduction of a new feature/set of features.
#          -  Compliance with a newer Core-specification introducing a 
#             significant impact on profile use-cases.
#          -  Improvements to an existing API set that have been "extended" 
#             in a minor release.
#
#   MINOR_VERSION:
#          This version indicates that new features have been introduced in 
#          a release. The new features introduced must be configurable. 
#          Their introduction should be protected under a compile-time flag.
#          There should be no functionality changes by default for customers 
#          upgrading to a minor version release. However, it should be 
#          possible to include the new functionality by enabling the compile 
#          flag.
#
#  FIX_VERSION:
#          This is incremented for a bug-fix release under a minor version 
#          release line. The bug fix release inherits the qualification of 
#          the minor release. 
#          API is backward compatible with the dot release of the minor version.
#          New API changes that do not break the backward compatibility 
#          are allowed.
#          No functionality is introduced which shall compromise the 
#          qualification of the minor release.
