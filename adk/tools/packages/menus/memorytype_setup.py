Will allow the user to specify a bespoke flash memory chip type option to be used.
The project definition file can be updated automatically by the script to include
the memory option settings file. Picking the defaults option means that by default
there will be no active contents, but when a user selects another memory option then
this file is overwritten with the bespoke contents. When there is no active content,
only the flash parts already known by the device ROM are supported.

    The parameters are:
    memorytype_setup.py <devkit root> <workspace>

    -k --devkit_root    Specifies path to the root folder of the devkit to use.
    -w --workspace      Specifies workspace file to use.
