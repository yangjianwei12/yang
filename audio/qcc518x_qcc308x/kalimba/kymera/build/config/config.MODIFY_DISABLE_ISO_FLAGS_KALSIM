# See B-302331 for why these flags are here:
# XXX install temporary transitional backward compatibility bodge to
# cope with KATS prior to change of shape of ISO_PARAMS_UNFRAMED
# message; see B-297787. Once KATS catches up, this option should
# be bodily removed.
TODO_ISO_SUPPORT_PRE_202002_SERVICE_MSG
# XXX: support getting BLE isochronous endpoints over ACCMD via
# STREAM_DEVICE_SCO. This is a transitional arrangement for backward
# compatibility with KATS tests until they move to using
# STREAM_DEVICE_ISO. Once the KATS tests catch up, this option
# should be bodily removed.
TODO_STREAM_DEVICE_SCO_SUPPORTS_ISO
# XXX: if the to-air ISO driver finds itself with nothing to send,
# normally it would send a zero-length NO_DATA record. But
# (a) KATS currently doesn't like this (b) the condition seems to
# occur in KATS tests. So, bodge this out until that's somehow
# resolved.
TODO_ISO_SUPPRESS_TO_AIR_NO_DATA_RECORDS
# Do not send a zero-length frame size in the RUN_STATE message to BTSS,
# for Kalsim builds
