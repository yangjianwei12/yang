# Common definitions for all builds

%cpp
KYMERA
# I think we can assume all chips will have these
# kalimba asm specific
BASE_REGISTER_MODE
DEBUG_STACK_OVERFLOW
# this identifies the compiler, needed by some software builds on multiple compilers, like QVA
__KALIMBA__

# We use the "Oxygen" preemptive scheduler
OS_OXYGOS

# The bigint module provides support for 64 bit integers.
# Intrinsic means it uses type long long else uses a structure of 2 int32s
BIGINT_64BIT_INTRINSIC

# Let bigint know endianness for efficient access into 64 bit integers.
BIGINT_64BIT_LITTLE_ENDIAN

# We define 64-bit types in types.h, so stop bigint trying to do it as well
BIGINT_64BIT_EXTERNALLY_DEFINED

# Flag to turn off periodic licence checks, which are not used if one-off checking is to be done
# (e.g. remote licence manager and/or licence key cannot deal with expiry period).
# No effect is NONSECURE_PROCESSING is defined.
NONPERIODIC_LICENCE_CHECKS

# Otherwise, the following two definitions are used to compute the required
# stack size (and so are only relevant for target builds)

# This is the number of different task priorities we actually use
# FIXME: we really use rather more than 1 these days...
NUM_USED_TASK_PRIORITIES=1
# This is the number of different interrupt levels we might actually use
# (although nothing currently uses mid priority)
NUM_USED_INTERRUPT_LEVELS=3

PRESERVE_BLOCK_WORDS=9

# Remove any code which relies on the old Previn messaging library
#HYDRA_REMOVE_XAP_MESSAGING

# ConfigCmd has a problem with the filename formatting in config files
# Until it is fixed, ignore the filename check in mib_loader
#MIB_IGNORE_CFG_FILENAME_CHECK

# build debug version of kalimba libs (and other asm code)
#DEBUG_ON

# Enable debug features in CBOPS library (additional to the above)
CBOPS_DEBUG

# Enable extra debug logging in CBOPS, primarily for discard and underrun operators
#CBOPS_DEBUG_LOGGING

# Enable profiler
PROFILER_ON
INTERRUPT_PROFILER_ON
# This increases memory usage slightly and MIPS somewhat.
DETAILED_PROFILER_ON

# Profiling info can be collected from SCO and ISO endpoints by enabling this flag:
#INSTALL_SCOISO_EP_PROFILING

# Cbuffer read / write pointer validation
# If enabled, check that addresses passed to $cbuffer.set_write_address /
# $cbuffer.set_read_address are within the range of the buffer
#CBUFFER_RW_ADDR_DEBUG

# Enable stream_connect diagnostic debug word.
# (A fault code is written to memory when a stream_connect command fails.)
STREAM_CONNECT_FAULT_CODE

# Enable slower adaptation to detect blockiness of data arriving to audio sinks
SLOW_BLOCK_SIZE_DETECTION

# Sync'ed sources keep copied data amounts in unison. If their output buffer available space is
# to also limit the copied amount (and not just the available input data across the sync group),
# then enable the following flag.
SYNCED_SOURCES_CHECK_SPACE

# Allow PCM loopback to override the use of the PCM port.
# This is to support SB-1485
#ALLOW_LOOPBACK_TO_STEAL_ENDPOINTS

# Use the middle quality rate adjustment filter coefficients
SRA_HIGH_QUALITY_COEFFS

# Choice of implementation of operator shared data synchronisation
OPMGR_SYNC_KICKED_IMPLEMENTATION=OPMGR_SYNC_KICKED_BASIC
OPMGR_SYNC_STRICT_TIMER_IMPLEMENTATION=OPMGR_SYNC_STRICT_TIMER_LEGACY

# KYMERA_API_LEVEL encapsulate the concept of firmware images independently
# of the chip. It gets incremented everytime a new chip is taped out.
# This is used by KATS patch test to figure out which prototype to use.
KYMERA_API_LEVEL=2

# Source directory list, used for places to look for uses of changed CPP symbols
